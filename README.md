# Text Analytics Dashboard

Note that the =front/= directory still contains traditional "back-end"

## User Interface

I really like Material. There is [Svelte
Material](https://sveltematerialui.com/), however it didn't work
out-of-the-box for me. Also, there is a lot going on there -- I don't
necessarily like have custom components for everything. I'd like to
have mostly CSS with some custom component behavior where I need
it. So maybe [Matter](https://github.com/finnhvman/matter) is a better
solution. Normally I would just say stick with the easiest solution,
but since Svelte Material didn't work right away...
